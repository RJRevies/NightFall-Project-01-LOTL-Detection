🧩 Scenario Summary
A SOC receives an alert:
“Workstation in VLAN 10 is communicating with a host in VLAN 20.”
This should be impossible under proper segmentation.
Your mission is to:
1.	Build the network
2.	Trigger the anomaly
3.	Collect evidence
4.	Identify the root cause
5.	Apply the fix
6.	Document the investigation
________________________________________
1. Build the Mini Network (5 minutes)
Topology
•	1 × Cisco 2960 Switch
•	2 × PCs 
o	PC A (should be VLAN 10)
o	PC B (should be VLAN 20)
IP Addressing
Device	VLAN	IP Address	Mask
PC A	10	10.10.10.10	255.255.255.0
PC B	20	10.20.20.20	255.255.255.0
Switch Configuration
vlan 10
vlan 20

interface fa0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10

interface fa0/2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
At this point, the network is properly segmented.
________________________________________
2. Inject the Anomaly (The Twist)
Packet Tracer PCs do not support manual ARP injection (arp -s), so we simulate the anomaly using a realistic misconfiguration.
Misconfigure PC A’s port
On the switch:
interface fa0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
Now PC A believes it’s in VLAN 10 (based on its IP), but the switch is treating it as VLAN 20.
This creates the cross VLAN leak.
________________________________________
3. Trigger the Incident
On PC A:
ping 10.20.20.20
Expected Result
You receive successful replies.
This is the “incident”:
A host in VLAN 10 is communicating with VLAN 20.
________________________________________
4. Collect Evidence (Packet Tracer Friendly)
Because some Packet Tracer builds do not support ARP table inspection, we rely on VLAN and MAC evidence.
Run on the switch:
show vlan brief
show mac address-table
What you’re looking for
•	PC A’s MAC address appearing under VLAN 20
•	PC A’s port listed under VLAN 20
•	VLAN boundaries not matching expected design
This is enough evidence to confirm the anomaly in Packet Tracer.

💡 Real World Commentary (for your portfolio)
In a real SOC environment, you would also inspect:
•	ARP tables
•	Switchport security logs
•	DHCP logs
•	NAC (802.1X) authentication
•	SIEM alerts
•	NetFlow or packet captures
Packet Tracer does not expose all these layers, so VLAN and MAC evidence is sufficient for simulation.
This commentary shows recruiters you understand the difference between lab limitations and real enterprise operations.
________________________________________
5. Identify the Root Cause
Your investigation should conclude:
PC A was able to communicate with VLAN 20 because its switchport was misconfigured and assigned to VLAN 20 instead of VLAN 10.
This is a classic segmentation failure.
________________________________________
6. Apply the Fix
Correct the switchport:
interface fa0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
Verify:
show vlan brief
show mac address-table
PC A should now appear under VLAN 10.
