10:00 – Investigation started. Prepared environment for packet capture.
10:02 – Opened Command Prompt and initiated continuous ICMP traffic using: ping 1.1.1.1 -t
10:03 – Opened second Command Prompt window and generated HTTP traffic using: curl http://example.com
10:04 – Stopped ICMP traffic with Ctrl + C.
10:05 – Launched Wireshark and began packet capture on primary network interface.
10:06 – Observed ICMP and HTTP packets in real time.
10:07 – Stopped capture and saved file as NightFall3_Network_Anomaly.pcapng.
10:10 – Identified protocol differences using Wireshark filters (icmp, http).
10:15 – Opened Command Prompt and ran Nmap basic scan against local host.
10:17 – Executed Nmap script scan (-sC -sV) to enumerate services.
10:20 – Ran optional Nmap vulnerability script (--script vuln).
10:25 – Saved Nmap results to NightFall3_Nmap_Results.txt.
10:30 – Analyzed open ports, services, and potential risks.
10:35 – Compiled findings, IOCs, and MITRE mapping for case file.
