FULL BLUE TEAM REPORT Final
Detection, Analysis, and Response to LOTL Activity
1. Overview
The Blue Team conducted a full investigation into suspicious PowerShell activity identified through host based logs. The goal was to validate the hypothesis, identify indicators of compromise, reconstruct the attacker timeline, and determine the scope and impact of the simulated breach.

2. Detection Summary
Initial detection was triggered by:
•	PowerShell Script Block Logging showing encoded command execution
•	Sysmon Event ID 1 indicating suspicious PowerShell parent/child processes
•	Sysmon Event ID 3 showing repeated outbound network connections
•	Windows Security Logs confirming process creation anomalies
These events aligned with known LOTL attack patterns.

3. Investigation Steps
3.1 PowerShell Operational Logs
Analysts observed:
•	Encoded or obfuscated commands
•	Script blocks inconsistent with normal user activity
•	Module usage indicative of reconnaissance
These findings supported the hypothesis of malicious PowerShell activity.

3.2 Sysmon Event ID 1 – Process Creation
Sysmon logs revealed:
•	PowerShell launched with suspicious parameters
•	Parent process relationships inconsistent with normal workflows
•	Execution patterns matching known attacker behavior
This confirmed that PowerShell was being used as the primary execution vector.

3.3 Sysmon Event ID 3 - Network Connections
Outbound network connections were observed:
•	Repeated connections to an external IP
•	Consistent timing indicative of beaconing
•	No legitimate process justification
This behavior aligned with simulated C2 activity.

3.4 Windows Security Logs
Security logs provided:
•	Process creation events
•	User context validation
•	Confirmation that no privilege escalation occurred
These logs helped validate the timeline and scope.

4. Timeline of Events (Blue Team Reconstruction)
Time	Event	Log Source
T0	PowerShell launched with suspicious parameters	Sysmon ID 1
T0+1	Script block logging captures encoded command	PowerShell Operational
T0+5	Outbound network connection initiated	Sysmon ID 3
T0+5–T0+65	Repeated outbound connections (beaconing)	Sysmon ID 3
T0+10	Additional PowerShell module activity	PowerShell Operational
T0+15	Security log confirms process creation	Windows Security Log
This timeline mirrors common attacker behavior in LOTL intrusions.

5. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
(You will attach screenshots in your Evidence Enclosure)
•	Suspicious PowerShell script blocks
•	Encoded command execution
•	Unusual parent/child process relationships
•	Repeated outbound network connections
•	PowerShell activity outside normal user behavior

6. Impact Assessment
The simulated activity demonstrated:
•	Potential for fileless malware execution
•	Ability to perform reconnaissance
•	Ability to establish outbound communication
•	Risk of lateral movement if not detected
No actual data was accessed or exfiltrated.

7. Recommendations
Detection
•	Enable Script Block Logging and Module Logging across endpoints
•	Deploy Sysmon with a hardened configuration
•	Create alerts for encoded PowerShell commands
•	Monitor for abnormal parent/child process relationships
Prevention
•	Restrict PowerShell usage to authorized users
•	Enforce PowerShell Constrained Language Mode
•	Implement application control policies
Response
•	Investigate all encoded PowerShell activity
•	Review outbound network connections for anomalies
•	Validate user account activity for legitimacy

8. Blue Team Summary
The Blue Team successfully detected, analyzed, and reconstructed the simulated LOTL attack.
The investigation confirmed:
•	PowerShell was used for suspicious activity
•	Outbound network connections resembled C2 behavior
•	Logging captured all relevant telemetry
•	The hypothesis was validated
This demonstrates effective detection and response capability using native Windows tools.
